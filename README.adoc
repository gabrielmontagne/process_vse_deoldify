We use the conda deoldify environment, as per https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify, with a local editablle install.
Also, we use https://github.com/gabrielmontagne/xyy and its dependencies.

Run this from within the DeOldify folder to have relative access to the downloaded models.

Note: The server will use the `xyy_render_factor` custom property fcurve on the scene if present.  The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 45.   The default is 35.

== To install:

=== Clone jantic's DeOldify repo.

Use follow his instructions to create a conda environment.

Download the generator and critic pretrained weights from his links and save them in a `models` folder 

Note, it seems that the environment in the DeOldify repo is a bit too leninent, I had to downgrade Pillow to 6.1 (even force it a bit) for this to work on my setup.
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/4130
Install, `python setup.py develop`

On that environment, install review the dependencies for xyy (as some might conflict with DeOldify) and then install it (perhaps as editable)
Install, `python setup.py develop`

On that environment, install this module, which will create the command line program `process_vse_deoldify`.

You can run this from _DeOldify's own folder_ so that the downloaded files cna be used.
